#  GPT-2 From Scratch (PyTorch)

A full GPT-2 implementation built from scratch in PyTorch and trained on **10 billion tokens** using **8× NVIDIA A100 GPUs** in parallel. This project is a deep dive into the inner workings of transformer architectures, with custom modules, efficient training optimizations, and scalable data handling.

---

##  Overview

-  Built completely from scratch — **no Hugging Face**, no pre built layers
-  Full implementation of GPT-2's decoder only transformer
-  Trained using **Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)** across 8× A100 GPUs
-  Tokenized and processed **10 billion tokens** over 4 hours
-  Optimized with: **gradient accumulation**, **custom weight init**, **dynamic optimizer configs**, and **sharded data loaders**

---

##  Motivation

The goal of this project was to **recreate GPT-2 from scratch** to gain a real, working understanding of how large-scale transformers operate. Every component from embeddings to attention to loss computation was implemented manually to demystify the black box and optimize for real world performance.

##  Architecture Overview

- **Decoder only transformer** modeled after GPT-2
- Multihead masked self attention
- Position wise feedforward layers
- **Residual connections** and **layer normalization** throughout
- Learned positional embeddings
- Fully compatible with autoregressive language modeling

##  Training Setup

###  Environment:
- Training was run via SSH on a distributed cluster with:
  - **8× NVIDIA A100 GPUs**
  - **PyTorch DistributedDataParallel (DDP)** for synchronized parallelism

###  Dataset:
- Source: [FineWeb Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cerebras/FineWeb)
- ~**10 billion tokens** total
- Custom DataLoader built to stream and batch across **sharded datasets**

### 🔧 Optimizations Used:

| Optimization                     | Purpose                                      |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
|  **Custom Weight Initialization** | Reduce loss volatility early in training     |
|  **Gradient Accumulation**        | Simulate large batch sizes efficiently       |
|  **DDP Training**                | Utilize 8 GPUs in parallel without redundancy|
|  **Dynamic Optimizer Config**    | Separate parameter groups by decay rules     |
|  **Sharded Data Loading**        | Stream massive datasets efficiently          |
|  **Residual Connections**        | Preserve gradient flow across deep layers    |
